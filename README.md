# PPPred Dataset
The file dataset.csv contains the dataset that we used for relation extraction. Proteins and phenotypes has been replaced by PROT and PHENO in the sentences and ProteinName and PhenotypeName can be used as the original terms used. UniProtId and HPOId columns also contain the mapping between the recognized proteins and phenotypes in text.
